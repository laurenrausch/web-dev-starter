# Running my website!

## Step 1

Before you get to running the website, clone this repository and run the following commands:

```bash
npm install
```
You will need npm installed to be able to run my tests!

## Step Two

It is recommendd you run this code inside of VSCODE for best results. Once you have opened the repository, on a new command line,
to run the tests you will run the following command:

    npm test
or 

    npm run test

This will execute all of the tests which should all pass!

## Step Three

To run the website within VSCode you can either run it through the built in Run and Debug tool in VSCode or with these key strokes:

    Ctrl+Shift+D
Or you can run it through Live Preview (I did find it hit and miss for the pop ups to work so I recommend the first way.), run it with the following commands: 

    Ctrl+Shift+P
    Live Preview: Start Sever

From here you should be able to use the website and get the desired results!
